OWEN TM v4 - Christopher Brenon
New Features:
- Added a Reset All button to the menu to reset, clear tape, and load the input tape.
- When working with a quadruple machine, each field (new state and move direction) disables the other field when it changes from NULL, so the user knows that they can't enter both.
- When a node is inserted, no window pops up asking for the node name, allowing for quicker placement of nodes.
- If a node is double clicked in select mode, its name can be changed.
- The umber of states and transitions is shown on the bottom of the screen
- Program asks for quadruple or quintuple machine at the very start - removes dropdown inside
- Allow user to determine type at command-line
- Allow user to specify input file at command-line
- Add option to open new window with "New" in file menu
- Allow user to clear current TM with "Clear" option in file menu

Bugfixes:
- When nodes are created, they find the lowest unused number as their name
- Two nodes cannot both have the same name

Known bugs:
- If a file is saved when the zoom is not 0, the nodes will have their location saved as their apparent location, rather than absolute location.
- Count of states is not updated until next action is taken when a node is deleted

Additional feature ideas:
- Ability to add comments to the drawing area
- Allow for mass copy-pasting and deleting of nodes and transitions
- Add shortcut buttons (for saving, changing modes, etc)
