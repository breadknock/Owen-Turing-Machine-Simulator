- Show number transitions when doing multiple inputs

- ~~Only allow for user to select TM type when a new TM is created~~
    - ~~Automatically detect TM type when opening machine~~
- ~~Allow user to open Turing Machine file from command-line~~
- Allow user to select TM type on command-line
- Allow for user to create comments
- Allow for user to rectangularly select nodes & transitions
- Allow for user to copy and paste nodes and transitions
- ~~Change "New TM" to clear, and give a "New TM" option that opens a new window~~
