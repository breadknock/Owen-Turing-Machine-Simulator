From command-line:
Run java -jar TuringMachine4.jar [input file] [-type=quad|quint]
From the command line, the user can select an input file, as well as the type of machine to open.
Also, you can run java -jar TuringMachine4.jar -h to get these usage instructions.

Otherwise, if you drag an input file onto the .jar or .bat file (on windows), the software will open with that TM file.
