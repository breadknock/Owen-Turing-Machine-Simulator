- ~~Show number of states and transitions~~
- ~~Show number transitions when doing multiple inputs~~
- ~~Only allow for user to select TM type when a new TM is created~~
    - ~~Automatically detect TM type when opening machine~~
- ~~Allow user to open Turing Machine file from command-line~~
- ~~Change "New TM" to clear, and give a "New TM" option that opens a new window~~
- ~~Fix behavior when user presses the close button on a pop-up~~
- shortcut buttons
- Allow user to select TM type on command-line
